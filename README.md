# 09Professional-ReadMe-Generator
## User Story

As a developer I want a README generator so that I can quickly create a professional README for a new project.

## Acceptance Criteria
Given a command-line application that accepts user input, when I am prompted for information about my application repository then a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.

When I enter my project title then this is displayed as the title of the README.

When I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions then this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests.

When I choose a license for my application from a list of options then a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under.

When I enter my GitHub username then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile.

When I enter my email address then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions.

When I click on the links in the Table of Contents then I am taken to the corresponding section of the README.
